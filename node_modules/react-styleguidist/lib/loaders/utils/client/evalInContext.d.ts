 *   advance to be able to bundle them with the code).
 * - `state` variable, `setState` function that will be binded to a React
 *   component that manages example’s state on the frontend.
 *
 * Also prepends a given `code` with a `header` (maps required context modules
 * to local variables: React, current component and modules defined via the
 * `context` config option).
